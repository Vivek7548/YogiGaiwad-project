## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema
- **User:** `{ username, password }`
- **Book:** `{ title, author, genre, description, publishedYear }`
- **Review:** `{ book, user, rating, comment }` (one review per user per book)

## üí° Design Decisions
- JWT is used for stateless authentication.
- Passwords are hashed with bcryptjs.
- MongoDB is used for simplicity and flexibility.
- Reviews are paginated and only editable/deletable by their authors.

---

## üìö Tips
- Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for easier API testing.
- Make sure to include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header for protected routes: `Bearer <token>`
- You can extend this API with features like user roles, book cover uploads, etc.
